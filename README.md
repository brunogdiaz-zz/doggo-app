# Doggo-App

A RESTful API to track important information about office dogs. 

Dog‚Äôs schema contains
```
unique ID
the dog‚Äôs name
the dog‚Äôs owner‚Äôs name
notes about the dog
```

The methods and endpoints should be:
```
GET /dogs - List all dogs
POST /dogs - Add a new dog üòÑ
GET /dogs/:id - Get details for one dog
PUT /dogs/:id - Update details for one dog
DELETE /dogs/:id - Remove a dog ‚òπÔ∏è
```

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brunogdiaz/doggo-app.git
cd doggo-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Once its running, feel free to using something like Postman to try it out.
For endpoints like POST /dogs and PUT /dogs/:id, the data sent should be in JSON format in the request body

## Improvements Needed

Since this is just a MVP of the application, a lot of things are missing. I stopped once it completed all the endpoints necessary to work were working. 

1. The GET /dogs currently returns the IDs of the dogs with the dog's info. The User shouldn't be caring about the ID generated by the "db". This can easily be fixed by parsing the values of the db['dogs'][ids] and just returning the needed information. 
2. For endpoints like POST /dogs, PUT DELETE /dogs/:id, since the JSON is acting as a DB, the JSON file is being completely rewritten. Obviously this is bad, can easily be dealt with putting the data in a real Database.
3. There is a lot of Logging that can be done and the returns of errors can be much more descriptive.
4. Comments are missing.
5. I initially started with the schema of the db. Right now its not being used since a JSON is currently being used. The schema can be found in schema.sql.
6. Unit Testing is also missing.
